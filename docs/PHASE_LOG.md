# Phase Log

A short record of what each completed phase delivered, so a fresh session can
resume without re-reading all prior code. See `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for the
full plan.

## Phase 0 — Scaffolding & foundations ✅

**Delivered**
- npm workspaces monorepo: `backend/` (Express + PostgreSQL) and `frontend/`
  (React + Vite).
- Backend: app factory (`src/app.js`) separated from server entrypoint
  (`src/index.js`); central config (`src/config`); Knex connection +
  `checkConnection()` (`src/db`); `knexfile.js` with dev/test/production
  envs; `/health` route (200 up / 503 degraded).
- **Guardrail baked in:** `src/middleware/requestLogger.js` logs only an
  allow-list of safe fields (method, path, status, durationMs) and never reads
  `req.body`, query strings, or headers. Enforced by the named test
  `backend/tests/logging.test.js` ("never logs POST body field values").
- Test harness: Jest + Supertest (backend), Vitest + Testing Library
  (frontend). `npm test` runs both. All green; frontend production build OK.
- Root `.env.example` + `backend/.env.example`, `.gitignore` (ignores `.env`,
  `node_modules`, build output), `README.md`.

**Verified**
- `npm test` → 7 tests pass (5 backend, 2 frontend), no warnings.
- Backend boots; `/health` returns 503/`db: down` gracefully with no DB
  running; logger output confirmed to contain only safe fields; 404 JSON works.
- `npm run build` (frontend) succeeds.

**Notes for next phase**
- No PostgreSQL is running in the build environment; `/health` reporting
  `degraded` there is expected. Phase 1 should provision a local/containerized
  Postgres (or point `DATABASE_URL` at one) to run migrations.
- Migration + seed directories are configured in `knexfile.js`
  (`backend/migrations`, `backend/seeds`) but empty — Phase 1 fills them.

## Next: Phase 1 — Data model & schema (Opus 5)

Build the full schema (`Campaign, Participant, Interaction, TrainingAssignment,
LearningModule, Quiz`) as Knex migrations. The `Interaction` table must have
**no column** capable of holding a credential, enforced at the schema level
with a named test asserting the exact column set.
